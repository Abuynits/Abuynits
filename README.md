### Hey!!

I'm Alexiy, a sophomore at Purdue majoring in CS and Math 
with an unbreakable caffeine addiction
(even full-timers at SpaceX got concerned with my caffeine intake...).

I love learning anything new and learn best by getting my hands dirty.
For me, the best feeling in the world is when something works/clicks 
after bashing my head against a problem for hours or even days.

In my free time, I love hiking / mountain biking, and finding excuses to visit coffee shops.

#### Random facts:
- **Favorite Quote:** "If you are not in pain, you are not learning." - Employee at SpaceX
- **Second Favorite Quote:** "Oooooh yea I dont like this problem. It came off a graduate qualifying exam. I put it on there just to torment people, even I don't know how to do it" - MA 453 Prof
- **Favorite Coffee Shop:** Mount Currie Coffee Co in Whistler B.C. (Philz Coffee is close second)
- **Favorite Hike:** Sahale Arm / Cascade Pass in North Cascades National Park
- **Foreign Languages:** Ukrainian, Russian, a bit of Spanish
-  **Favorite Book:** The Martian by Andy Weir

Here's a summary of things I've worked on, feel free to reach out with any questions or just to say hello!

## 🚀 Major Projects

[4/19 Robotics and Intelligent Systems Expo Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ptyTvIiC8olL6KaQOJGcismDRnHc2IlFwnCtY0GxeYg/edit?usp=sharing)

- Build standardized, trackable, reproducible framework with MLFlow and DVC
- Use and compare performance of LSTM, time-transformers, DeepESN, temporal fusion transformers, seq2seq at predicting time-series data
- Compare model performance from introducing new data features, changing data augmentation, and adding external indicators
- **Final result:** Achieve 83% accuracy at an 18-month prediction and 81% accuracy at a 76-week prediction

|
[wiki]([wiki](http://www.purduearc.com/wiki/active-projects/rocket-league/))
- Improve performance by randomizing training parameters using Rospy libraries and ROS on the autonomy stack
- Refactor simulator to better reflect real-world conditions by randomizing game object physics dynamics, tuning car properties, and simulating latency
- Implement multi-agent training



**🐶 BoilermakeX Purdue Hackathon 1st place Dagshub Winner**
[dagshub repo](https://dagshub.com/Abuynits/airQ)
|
[Wiki](https://devpost.com/software/airq)
|
- LSTM and seq2seq model that predicts specified air quality metrics using input and output features
- Built using Pytorch, with DVC and MLflow to allow for easy testing and augmentation

## ⚡ Minor Projects

**📝 Autograders** 
[cs240](https://github.com/Abuynits/cs240MomentRemover) 
|
[cs180](https://github.com/Abuynits/CS180Autograder)
- Used Perl and Bash scripts to run testcases on homework for CS240 and CS180
- Prevented me from getting 0's on hw because of using "\t" instead of "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

**🗿📄✂ Tensorflow Rock Paper Scissors** 
[github repo](https://github.com/Abuynits/rock_paper_scissor/) 

- Achieve >90% accuracy with 32k parameters for playing rock-paper-scissors
- Use a simplified VGG-19 architecture with data augmentation and inference on live images
